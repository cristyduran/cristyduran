### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Cristy
#### I am a fullstack software engineer

I'm Cristina, from California, and I specialize in Software Engineering. I really enjoy creating full stack applications that make my life as a teacher easier. I'm surrently working on creating one now. Although I'm a fast learner, I enjoy specializing in Javascript libraries with an additional interest in SQL databases. I'm also a bootcamp graduate and am open to software engineering and development positions where I can thrive as part of a team. 

Skills: REACT / JS / HTML / CSS / SQL / Node.JS

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an application that helps me keep track of student participation. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about Secure Software Development and Databases with SQL.  
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love playing the cello!
