### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Cristina, from California, and I specialize in Software Engineering. I really enjoy creating full stack applications that make my life as a teacher easier. I'm surrently working on creating one now. Although I'm a fast learner, I enjoy specializing in Javascript libraries with an additional interest in SQL databases.
